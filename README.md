## Docs
[820-1152-A.pdf](/docs/820-1152-A.pdf) contains a poor schematic of the
original VRM board in the Power Mac G4 Cube, drawn only to verify whether or not
there was anything "unusual" about the OEM design (for all intents and purposes,
there isn't).
[np7400_VRM.pdf](/docs/np7400_VRM.pdf) contains the KiCad schematic of the
upgraded VRM board in PDF.
## Schematic and Board Layout
Schematic/layout files are provided as a complete KiCad project. As of the time
of this writing, schematic has been somewhat revised and does not reflect the
older revision of the layout included.

The newer schematic has not been thouroughly proofread. The older layout has not
been tested extensively and should not be used; there is considerable room for
improvement. Most planned changes are regarding optimization of routing, and ease
of assembly.
